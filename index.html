        <p>Hi! This is my website to make your JEE journey easier. You probably won't be here if you are already close
            to getting 97 percentile. I myself went from 35 percentile to 94. <s>if my qualifications matter to you;
            you prolly would just read this and then go about your day.</s> I'll tell you what all I know, the onus is on you to
            actually integrate this stuff in your life.</p>
        <p>There are a few things I need to get out of the way first.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First of all, you have have 2 paths now. Either screw school and study online<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/twnr3t/tips_for_people_going_into_class_11th_and_are"></a>
                or screw school and go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kota,_Rajasthan#Education">Kota</a>. I
                only have faith in the kota method and would be describing that there, but online method has been
                followed successfully done by some, so it <i>is</i> possible</li>
            <li>Second, I did this all in my drop year but I encourage you to start prep from 11th. Its the prime time
                to get into the JEE race. 10th is too early, and drop year too late. It becomes nigh impossible to get
                good marks in Math in your drop year cz of </li>
            <li> Third, I imagine weather you are living in hostel, with mum or in a family it won't matter much. Just
                get a room where you can be alone and have AC. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now with that stuff out of the way; Here are some <a href="kota.html">tips for kota</a> in particular. These
            will help you generally get an overview about this brave new world. If there's only one file you are gonna read through, it should be this one.</p>
        <p> Subject related tips: Every subject in your JEE prep have to be looked through a different lens. The techniques to study one rarely applies to other.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="subject/chemistry.html">Chemistry</a></li>
            <li> <a href="subject/math.html">Maths </a></li>
            <li> <a href="subject/physics.html">Physics </a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are some <a href="resources.html"> resources</a> that helped me out a lot personally.</p>
        <p>In general JEE prep is always like fire on a clay pot. It will shape you. Only difference is if you pass through this test, you'd always come better on the other hand.
            So, don't you dare go hallow on me, friend.</p>
