          <blockquote>To lose a mark in chemistry is to sabotage yourself</blockquote>
          <p>Chemistry is the most scoring subject in JEE. Even if you are a math teacher in Kota, you bet you have had got better marks in chemsitry for JEE Mains</p>
          <p class = "list-heading">There are but 2 things that applies to chemistry as a whole entity:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Study all of it. Almost no chapter can be left in here, if you want to get a decent JM score. Even teachers know it and your chemistry syllbus should always be complete by their side. The onus is on you to do practise questions and revise.</li>
            <li>NCERT is the bible of chemistry. Questions can come word to word from it in JM. To read chemistry once is a given, to read it twice is bare minimum.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Now chemistry is divided into 3 branches, each with a unique method of studying and scoring in it. To appoach each with its own style is going to save you a heck of a trouble.</p>
        <div class="inorganic box dark-box">
          <h2>Inorganic chemistry</h2>
            <p>This is easily the subject that takes up point 2 and runs away with it. Marries it, and have children with it.
              Some chapters like Enviromnent Chemistry in inorganic are considered chapters who's only purpose for their existance is to give you marks, as questions from it come line to line from NCERT.</p>
            <p> This is also the subject that's responsible for the famous adage, <q>chemistry tho ratta hai</q>. Especially the blocks chapters(s,p,d,f, hydrogen) and salts are a major culprit for it. There's little to no understanding a reaction, there's only remembering.</p>
            <p>The importance of periodic table in inorganic cannot be overstated. Its imperitive that you use mnemonic(like <a href="https://www.epaperpdf.com/tricks-to-remember-the-elements-in-periodic-table/">this</a> one)to easily remember them column wise. You need to also remember elements till 30 row wise(20-30 -> Suno tum vivah karlo mujhse phir koi nahi kahega zanu) </p>

              <h2>Organic chemistry</h2>
                <p>In words of my math teacher, organic chemistry is like physics. Its all about imagination. I concur, this is a part of mastering the art of organic chemistry. Most of the organic chemistry lies in 2end part of 12th, NCERT book and I had consumed most of it for boards so my organic was pretty good. Here a few pointers:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Half of organic is just remembering reagents and products from named reactions(Use NCERT). The other half is remembering mechanism to give the products for unamed reactions. </li>
                  <li>You have to reguarly do questions(From your module/Race) for Organic after completing the chapter. You are free to consult notes/NCERT to complete the first batch.</li>
                  <li>I highly discourage you from leaving out a chapter in organic as the questions that appear in JEE regularly require you to use reagents from multiple chapters.</li>
                  <li>Listen to your teacher explain the mechanism for a reaction, you won't realise it till the end, but the reactions that you struggle to visualise the the ones in which you weren't highly attentive to what the teacher was saying</li>
                  <li>For visualisation a great tool is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alchemie.modelset&hl=en&gl=US">Model AR</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p> <span  class="h6">Reason for doing questions:</span> For revision. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="space whitespace"></div>
              <div class="Physical box dark-box">
                <h2>Physical chemistry</h2>
                  <p>To master Physical chemistry, you just have to complete the homework given. BOOM. That's the thing my teacher told us in the first lesson and I still think its the only way.</p>
                  <p>Some other tips:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If you can't complete 100% of the homework, it doesn't matter tbh. 75% is 100%. Anything >50% and you are considered to have done your homework</li>
                    <li>I advice you to only use calculator when you have reduced your calculation to something that you are sure can't be reduced to simpler terms. In exams half of the point in asking physical chemistry questions is to see how can you recognise when a calculation can be done in a simpler way</li>
                    <li>Maintain shortnotes of formulaes after each chapter</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p> <span  class="h6">Reason for doing questions:</span> For recognition of which formula corresponds to which question.. </p>
